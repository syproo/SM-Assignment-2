a specific number to any number passed to it. For example, if the closure is
created with 5, the returned function should add 5 to any number passed
to it.

2. Write a recursive function that searches an array for a specific value. The
function should return true if the value is found, and false if it is not. You
can assume that the array is not nested.

document. The function should take a string argument that will be used as
the text content of the new list item.

The function should take two arguments: the first argument is a reference
to the HTML element, and the second argument is a string representing
the new background color.

take two arguments: the first argument is a string representing the key to

should take one argument, which is a string representing the key used to
store the object. The function should return the object.
